</p>


This manual is intended to be used for **incoming, current, and outgoing** members of the English lab group. If we missed anything, please let Justin English (justingenglish@gmail.com) or Katie Rondem (katie.rondem@biochem.utah.edu) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!
